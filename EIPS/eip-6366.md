## Abstract

This EIP offers an alternative to Access Control Lists (ACLs) for granting authorization and enhancing security. Each permission is represented by a single bit in `uint256` from which we can defined up to `256` permissions and `2²⁵⁶` roles. This approach use bitwise operator and bitmask to determine the access right which is much more efficient and flexible than `string` comparison or `keccak()`. We are able to specify the importance of permission based on the bit order.

## Motivation

Special roles like `Owner`, `Operator`, `Manager`, `Validator` are common for many smart contracts because permissioned addresses are used to administer and manage them. It is difficult to audit and maintain these system since these permissions are not managed in a single smart contract.

Since permission and role are reflected by the permission token balance of the relevant account in the given ecosystem, cross-interactivity between many ecosystems will be made simpler.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

_Note_ The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.8.7` (or above)

### Core Interface

Compliant contracts MUST implement `IEIP6366Core`.

```solidity
interface IEIP6366Core {
  event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);

  event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _delegatee, uint256 _permission);

  function transfer(address _to, uint256 _permission) external returns (bool success);

  function approve(address _delegatee, uint256 _permission) external returns (bool success);

  function permissionOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 permission);

  function permissionRequire(uint256 _required, uint256 _permission) external view returns (bool isPermissioned);

  function hasPermission(address _owner, address _actor, uint256 _required) external view returns (bool isPermissioned);

  function delegated(address _owner, address _delegatee) external view returns (uint256 permission);
}
```

It is RECOMMENDED to define each permission as a power of `2` so that we can check for the relationship between sets of permissions using the bitwise operator and bitmask.

_Example_

```text
const PERMISSION_NONE = 0;
const PERMISSION_READ = 1; // 2⁰
const PERMISSION_WRITE = 2; // 2¹
const PERMISSION_EXECUTE = 4; // 2²

// Role admin = 4 | 2 | 1 = 7
const ROLE_ADMIN = PERMISSION_READ | PERMISSION_WRITE | PERMISSION_EXECUTE;
// Role operator = 1 | 2 = 3
const ROLE_OPERATOR = PERMISSION_READ | PERMISSION_WRITE;
```

The most important permission SHOULD be greater than the lesser one.

#### transfer

Transfers a subset of `_permission` permission to address `_to`, and MUST emit the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `revert` if the message caller's account permission does not have the subset of the transferring permission. The function SHOULD `revert` if any of transferring permission is existing on target `_to` address.

_Note_ Transfers of `0` permission MUST be treated as normal transfers and emit the `Transfer` event.

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _permission) external returns (bool success);
```

#### approve

Allows `_delegatee` to act for the permission owner's behalf, up to the `_permission` permission, and MUST emit the `Approval` event. If this function is called again it overwrites the current granted with `_permission`.

_Note_ `_permission` MUST be a subset of all available permission of permission owner.

_Note_ `approve()` method SHOULD `revert` if granting `_permission` permission is not a subset of all available permission of permission owner.

```solidity
function approve(address _delegatee, uint256 _permission) external returns (bool success);
```

#### permissionOf

Returns the account permission of the given `_owner` address.

```solidity
function permissionOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 permission);
```

#### permissionRequire

Returns `true` if `_required` permission is a subset of `_permission` permission otherwise return `false`.

```solidity
function permissionRequire(uint256 _required, uint256 _permission) external view returns (bool isPermissioned);
```

### hasPermission

Returns `true` if `_required` permission is a subset of `_actor`'s permissions or a subset of his delegated permissions granted by the `_owner`.

```solidity
function hasPermission(address _owner, address _actor, uint256 _required) external view returns (bool isPermissioned);
```

#### delegated

Returns the subset permission of the `_owner` address were granted to `_delegatee` address.

```solidity
function delegated(address _owner, address _delegatee) external view returns (uint256 permission);
```

#### Transfer

MUST trigger when permission are transferred, including zero permission transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD emit a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to `address(0x00)` when tokens are created.

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```

#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _delegatee, uint256 _permission)`.

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _delegatee, uint256 _permission)
```

### Metadata Interface

It is RECOMMENDED for compliant contracts to implement the optional extension `IEIP6366Meta`.

```solidity
interface IEIP6366Meta {
  struct PermissionDescription {
    uint256 index;
    uint256 permission;
    string name;
    string description;
  }

  event UpdatePermissionDescription(uint256 indexed _permission, string indexed _name, string indexed _description);

  function name() external view returns (string memory);

  function symbol() external view returns (string memory);

  function getDescription(uint256 _index) external view returns (PermissionDescription memory description);

  function setDescription(uint256 _index, string memory _name, string memory _description) external returns (bool success);
}
```

#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"OpenPermissionToken"`.

```solidity
function name() external view returns (string memory);
```

#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. `"OPT"`.

```solidity
function symbol() external view returns (string memory);
```

#### getDescription

Return a description of a permission, at a given `_index`.

```solidity
function getDescription(uint256 _index) external view returns (PermissionDescription memory description);
```

#### setDescription

Return `true` if the description was set otherwise return `false`. It MUST emit `UpdatePermissionDescription` event.

```solidity
function setDescription(uint256 _index, string memory _name, string memory _description) external returns (bool success);
```

SHOULD define a relationship between `index` field and `permission` field in `PermissionDescription`. It is RECOMMENDED to define `permission` is 2 to the power of `index`.

#### UpdatePermissionDescription

MUST trigger when description is updated.

```solidity
event UpdatePermissionDescription(uint256 indexed _permission, string indexed _name, string indexed _description);
```

### Error Interface

SHOULD NOT expected `IEIP6366Error` interface was implemented.

```solidity
interface IEIP6366Error {
  error AccessDenied(address _owner, address _actor, uint256 _permission);

  error DuplicatedPermission(uint256 _permission);

  error OutOfRange();
}
```
